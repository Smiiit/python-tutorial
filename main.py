# Data Types

# Numbers:

# ------- INT -------
# one = 1
# print(type(one))

# ------ FLOAT ------
# TwoPointThree = 2.3
# print(type(TwoPointThree))

# ----- COMPLEX ----- which is an imaginary datatype used by keeping "j" at the last of word or number
# ImaginaryValue = ksdjskldslj    # string is not allowed in imaginery value only numbers and float can be imaginery value

# ImaginaryValue = 12.023232322222222222222222222222222222222222222222j
# print(type(ImaginaryValue))
